In truth this is not meant to be a comprehensive lesson on linear-algebra (though I may make that at some point!) but rather a brief refresher meant to do two things:\n\n\n1.) Disambiguate notation that will be commonly used throughout this website (this includes any future projects)\n\n\n2.) Provide what I believe is a unique perspective on some topics that will help to frame later ideas.\n\n\nWith all of that in mind, the first question we should answer is “What is a vector?”\nThe most concise answer is that a vector \\vec {v} is an element of a vector space \\textbf{V}. In order for a set \\textbf{V} to constitute a vector space, there is a list of requirements (called the vector axioms) which must be satisfied which are\n\\forall   (\\vec{u},\\vec{v},\\vec{w}) \\in\\textbf{R}^n \\quad \\vec{u}+(\\vec{v}+\\vec{w})=(\\vec{u}+\\vec{v})+\\vec{w}"}}
