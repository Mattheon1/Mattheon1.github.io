In truth this is not meant to be a comprehensive lesson on linear-algebra (though I may make that at some point!) but rather a brief refresher meant to do two things:\n\n\n1.) Disambiguate notation that will be commonly used throughout this website (this includes any future projects)\n\n\n2.) Provide what I believe is a unique perspective on some topics that will help to frame later ideas.\n\n\nWith all of that in mind, the first question we should answer is “What is a vector?”\nThe most concise answer is that a vector \\vec {u} is an element of a vector space \\textbf{V}. In order for a set \\textbf{V} to constitute a vector space, there is a list of requirements (called the vector axioms) that must be satisfied:\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\forall \\{\\vec{u},\\vec{v},\\vec{w}\\}\\in\\textbf{V},\n\\end{gathered}\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\vec{u}+(\\vec{v}+\\vec{w})=(\\vec{u}+\\vec{v})+\\vec{w}\n\\end{gathered}\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\vec{u}+\\vec{v}=\\vec{v}+\\vec{u}\n\\end{gathered}\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\exists!{\\vec{0}}\\in\\textbf{V} \\,s.t. \\quad\\vec{0}+\\vec{u}=\\vec{u}\n\\end{gathered}\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\exists!(−{\\vec{u}})\\in\\textbf{V} \\,s.t. \\quad(−\\vec{u})+\\vec{u}=\\vec{0}\n\\end{gathered}\n\\begin{gathered}\na(b\\vec{u})=(ab)\\vec{u}\n\\end{gathered}\n\\begin{gathered}\n1\\vec{u}=\\vec{u}\n\\end{gathered}\n\\begin{gathered}\n(a+b)(\\vec{u}+\\vec{v})=(a+b)\\vec{u}+(a+b)\\vec{v}=a(\\vec{u}+\\vec{v})+b(\\vec{u}+\\vec{v})\n=a\\vec{u}+b\\vec{u}+a\\vec{v}+b\\vec{v}\n\\end{gathered}\n(If these symbols such as \\forall or \\exists are unfamiliar you can copy paste them into wikepedia to get their meanings)\nThis definition is rather inclusive, and sets such as the set of nth degree polynomials or even \\{0\\} are valid examples of vector spaces.\nAs I said though this isn’t a linear algebra review, for the purposes of this guide we’ll only be working with finite dimensional vector spaces, and mostly with coordinate spaces such as \\textbf{R}^n"}}
