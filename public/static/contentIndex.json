This leads us to the more general concept of a linear combination.\nA linear combination of vectors is simply just a sum of vectors weighted by scalar coefficients. Given any indexable set of vectors from \\textbf{V} \\{\\vec{u}_1,...,\\vec{u}_n\\} (denoted S) we can compactly represent any linear combination of vectors within this set like:\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n}c_{i}\\vec{u}_i=c_1\\vec{u}_1+...+c_n\\vec{u}_n\n\\end{gathered}\nWhere each coefficient could be any arbitray scalar. Also take not that since \\textbf{V} is closed under both addition and multiplication, a linear combination of vectors is itself a vector. There isn’t much added benefit that comes from discussing specific linear combinations of vectors, as they are already fully described by the vector axioms. The main benefit of defining a linear combination as we have is the ability to construct the set of all linear combinations of a given set S, which we call the span.\nFormally the span of a subset S of a vector space \\textbf{V} over a  Field {\\textbf{F}} can be defined as:\n\\begin{gathered}\nspan(S)= \\left\\{\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n}c_{i}\\vec{u}_{i} \\,\\middle|\\, c_{i}\\in\\mathbf{F},\\vec{u}_i\\in S\n\\right\\}\n\\end{gathered}\nThe span of a set of vectors is special as far as subsets of \\textbf{V} go in that it can be demonstrated to have its own vector space strucutre. All axioms dealing with the properties of operations are automatically met as a subset of a \\textbf{V}, and the remaining two axioms (existence of additive inverse and identity) can be shown to be satisfied in the following ways:\nAdditive Inverse\n\\begin{gathered}\nlet \\,\\sum_{i=1}^nc_{i}\\vec{u}_{i}\\equiv\\vec{v}. \\\\ \\\\\\forall\\vec{v}\\in span(S),\\\\\\\\ -\\vec{v}=-\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^nc_{i}\\vec{u}_{i}\\right) =\\sum_{i=1}^n(-c_{i})\\vec{u}_{i}\\,,\\\\\\\\ \\sum_{i=1}^n(-c_{i})\\vec{u}_{i}\\in span(S)\n\\end{gathered}\nAdditive identity\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\vec{0}=\\sum_{i=1}^n\\vec{0}=\\sum_{i=1}^n0\\vec{u}_{i}\\, ,\\\\\\\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}0\\vec{u}_{i}\\in span(S)\n\\end{gathered}\nThus given any set of vectors in \\textbf{V}, the span of the set is simultaneously a subset of \\textbf{V} and a   vector space of its own. All such subsets are referred to as subspaces and are generally assumed to be subsets of larger vector spaces (though all vectors spaces are technically subspaces of themselves)\nThe span of a set of vectors is not unique however. Take two sets in \\textbf{V}, \\{\\vec{u}_{1},...,\\vec{u}_{n}\\} and \\{\\vec{u}_{1},...\\vec{u}_n+\\vec{u}_1\\} (Denoted S_1 and S_2 respectively).\n\\begin{gathered}\nspan(S_{1})= \\left\\{\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^nc_{i}\\vec{u}_{i}\\middle|c_{i}\\in\\textbf{F}\\right\\}, \\\\[1em]\\\\\nspan(S_{2})= \\left\\{\\left(\\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}c_{i}\\vec{u}_{i}\\right)+c_n\\left(\\vec{u}_{n}+\\vec{u}_{1}\\right)\\middle|c_{i}\\in\\textbf{F}\\right\\}.\n\\end{gathered}\nWe can pretty easily see that the span of both sets should be the same, as we could redefine c_{1}\\equiv c_{1}+c_{n} and represent the span of the second set in exactly the same form as the first set."},"math/Tensors":{"title":"Tensors","links":["math/Vectors"],"tags":[],"content":"\nSub-Topics\nVector and Coordinate Bases"},"math/Vectors":{"title":"Vectors","links":["math/What_is_a_vector"],"tags":[],"content":"\nWhy talk about vectors???\nGiven the complexity of some of the topics that will be covered in this guide, it may seem odd to start with what is likely the billionth vector review for most. While annoying for some, you can rest easy knowing this section is not intended to be a comprehensive lesson on linear-algebra, and in fact will seem blazingly quick for someone with little to no prior knowledge bout vector spaces (if you have no idea what a vector is, you might find this series helpful).\nInstead, the first part of this page (which serves as the boiler-plate review) serves two purposes:\n\n\n1.) Disambiguate notation that will be commonly used throughout this website (this includes any future projects)\n\n\n2.) Provide a smooth transition into the latter half of this page, which will most likely be new material for some.\n\n\nFrom the second half onward, it will be assumed that you at least know what a vector is and some basic facts about vector spaces and operations on vector spaces.\nIf you feel super confident in your knowledge and feel the first section would be a waste of time, click here.\nIf you want to go ahead with the quickest vector review of all time, then the first question we should ask ourselves is, What is a vector?\n\nLinear Independence and Vector Bases\nFor any subspace \\textbf{W} of a vector space \\textbf{V}, there are infinitely many choices of spanning sets S \\,\\,s.t. \\,span(S)=\\textbf{W}.\nThis is because the addition of a linear combination of vectors already in S doesn’t change the span of S, but still results in a completely new spanning set.

Luckily most of these requirements are things we tend to take for granted (like associativity) and so we wont have to reference them too much. We’ll also mostly be focusing on Euclidean vector spaces and that comes with a lot of geometric intuition that we can leverage.\nThe vector axioms define how to add vectors and multiply them by scalars, but a general framework for how to contruct new vectors by combining both of these operations is a must before we can go any further. Thus we must introduce the concept of a Linear Combination."}}
