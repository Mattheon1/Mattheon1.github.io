In truth this is not meant to be a comprehensive lesson on linear-algebra (though I may make that at some point!) but rather a brief refresher meant to do two things:\n\n\n1.) Disambiguate notation that will be commonly used throughout this website (this includes any future projects)\n\n\n2.) Provide what I believe is a unique perspective on some topics that will help to frame later ideas.\n\n\nWith all of that in mind, the first question we should answer is “What is a vector?”\nThe most concise answer is that a vector \\vec {u} is an element of a vector space \\textbf{V}. In order for a set \\textbf{V} to constitute a vector space, there is a list of requirements (called the vector axioms) that must be satisfied:\n\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\forall \\{\\vec{u},\\vec{v},\\vec{w}\\}\\in\\textbf{V},\n\\end{gathered}\n\n\n1.)\\quad\\vec{u}+\\vec{v}\\in\\textbf{V},\\quad a\\vec{u}\\in\\textbf{V}   |   (Closure under vector addition and scalar multiplication)\n\n\n2.)\\quad\\vec{u}+(\\vec{v}+\\vec{w})=(\\vec{u}+\\vec{v})+\\vec{w}   |   (associativity of addition)\n\n\n3.)\\quad\\vec{u}+\\vec{v}=\\vec{v}+\\vec{u}   |   (commutativity of addition)\n\n\n4.)\\quad\\exists!{\\vec{0}}\\in\\textbf{V} \\,s.t. \\quad\\vec{0}+\\vec{u}=\\vec{u}   |   (existence of additive identity)\n\n\n5.)\\quad\\exists!(−{\\vec{u}})\\in\\textbf{V} \\,s.t. \\quad(−\\vec{u})+\\vec{u}=\\vec{0}   |   (existence of additive inverse)\n\n\n6.)\\quad a(b\\vec{u})=(ab)\\vec{u}   |   (scalar multiplication is equivalent to Field multiplcation)\n\n\n7.)\\quad1\\vec{u}=\\vec{u}   |   (multiplication by the identity element returns the vector original vector)\n\n\n8.)\\quad(a+b)(\\vec{u}+\\vec{v})=(a+b)\\vec{u}+(a+b)\\vec{v}=a(\\vec{u}+\\vec{v})+b(\\vec{u}+\\vec{v})=a\\vec{u}+b\\vec{u}+a\\vec{v}+b\\vec{v}   |   (scalar multiplication distributes)\n\n\n(\\forall  means for all, \\exists! means there exists only one, and \\in means within)\nThis definition is rather dense and includes sets not commonly thought of as vector spaces (such as the set of nth degree polynomials or even \\{0\\}), however for the majority of this section we wont need to reference it and will tend to focus on what most people imagine when thinking of a vector space, Euclidean vector spaces .\n\nLinear Combinations and span\nAfter showing that a set \\textbf {V} is a vector space, the next natural step"}}
