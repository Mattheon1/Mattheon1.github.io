In truth this is not meant to be a comprehensive lesson on linear-algebra (though I may make that at some point!) but rather a brief refresher meant to do two things:\n\n\n1.) Disambiguate notation that will be commonly used throughout this website (this includes any future projects)\n\n\n2.) Provide what I believe is a unique perspective on some topics that will help to frame later ideas.\n\n\nWith all of that in mind, the first question we should answer is “What is a vector?”\nThe most concise answer is that a vector \\vec {u} is an element of a vector space \\textbf{V}. In order for a set \\textbf{V} to constitute a vector space, there is a list of requirements (called the vector axioms) that must be satisfied:\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\forall \\{\\vec{u},\\vec{v},\\vec{w}\\}\\in\\textbf{V},\n\\end{gathered}\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\vec{u}+(\\vec{v}+\\vec{w})=(\\vec{u}+\\vec{v})+\\vec{w}\n\\end{gathered}\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\vec{u}+\\vec{v}=\\vec{v}+\\vec{u}\n\\end{gathered}\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\exists!{\\vec{0}}\\in\\textbf{V} \\,s.t. \\quad\\vec{0}+\\vec{u}=\\vec{u}\n\\end{gathered}\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\exists!(−{\\vec{u}})\\in\\textbf{V} \\,s.t. \\quad(−\\vec{u})+\\vec{u}=\\vec{0}\n\\end{gathered}\n\\begin{gathered}\na(b\\vec{u})=(ab)\\vec{u}\n\\end{gathered}\n\\begin{gathered}\n1\\vec{u}=\\vec{u}\n\\end{gathered}\n\\begin{gathered}\n(a+b)(\\vec{u}+\\vec{v})=(a+b)\\vec{u}+(a+b)\\vec{v}=a(\\vec{u}+\\vec{v})+b(\\vec{u}+\\vec{v})\n=a\\vec{u}+b\\vec{u}+a\\vec{v}+b\\vec{v}\n\\end{gathered}"}}
