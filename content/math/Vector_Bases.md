title: Vector Bases and Coordinate Vectors

After having discussed vector spaces, linear combinations, span and linear inependence, we finally get to one of the most important concepts in linear algebra, that of a vector basis.

Just like it was defined towards the end of the section on [[linear_independence|linear independence]], a basis $B_{W}$ is a linearly independent set of a vector space from a space $\textbf{V}$ which spans a subspace $\textbf{W}$
