title: Vector Bases and Coordinate Vectors
---

Building upon the concepts of vector spaces, linear combinations, span, and linear independence, we now delve into one of the most useful concepts in linear algebra: the vector basis.

We had previously defined a basis $B_{W}$ as a linearly independent set of vectors from a space $\textbf{V}$ that spans a subspace $\textbf{W}$. The  Moreover, we can extend this concept to define a basis for the entire vector space $\textbf{V}$ (there is nothing special about subspaces except for the explicit relationship to a larger vector space. We introduced bases in reference to subspaces as it flows more intuitively from span this way, but theres no reason that we couldn't have had $\textbf{W}$ be an ordinary vector space and $B_{W}$ span it).

By representing vectors in terms of their basis decomposition, we can express vector operations like vector addition and scalar multiplication component-wise
