title: Euclidian Geometry and Spaces
---

Before we delve into the algebra of Euclidean vector spaces, it's essential to understand the geometric foundations upon which this algebra is built. Throughout much of history, mathematical thought was often justified and expressed using geometric relations, as symbolic reasoning wasn't developed enough to replicate what could be done with even simple straight edge and compass constructions.
