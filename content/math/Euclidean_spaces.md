title: Euclidian Geometry and Spaces
---

Before we delve into the algebra of Euclidean vector spaces, it's essential to understand the geometric foundations upon which this algebra is built. Throughout much of history, mathematical thought was often justified and expressed using geometric relations. While the ancient Greeks had a conception of numbers and arithmetic separate from geometry, it wasn't until the widespread adoption of Arabic numerals and the development of symbolic algebra that mathematical reasoning could be effectively carried out without relying on geometric figures.

In the pre-algebraic era, mathematical statements were often presented using a combination of geometric figures and formal logic meant to describe those figures. The use of geometry as a tool for understanding and solving problems can be traced back to ancient civilizations, such as bronze-age Mesopotamia. However, it was the Greek mathematician Euclid who would eventually axiomatize geometry and provide it with a rigorous construction.

Euclid's seminal work, "The Elements," laid the foundation for what we now know as Euclidean geometry. In this treatise, Euclid presented a set of axioms and postulates that he used to systematically derive a wide range of geometric propositions. These axioms were considered to be self-evident truths, and the propositions were derived using deductive reasoning. Using this system, rather than speak in terms of numbers and equality (for which the Greek's had separate concepts of), Euclid expressed his thoughts in terms of magnitudes and congruence. 

The Greeks considered the ideas of quantity and size/proportion to be distinct but related concepts. To the Greeks, numbers were quantities, things to count with and were equivalent to what we would now call the natural numbers. In contrast, a magnitude was a thing that described a measurement of one object, usually a line segment, in proportion to another. This comparison of magnitudes was done through careful constructions involving circles, translation and rotation.
