## Why talk about vectors???

Given the complexity of some of the topics that will be covered in this guide, it may seem odd to start with what is likely the billionth vector review for most. While annoying for some, you can rest easy knowing this section is not intended to be a comprehensive lesson on linear-algebra, and in fact will seem blazingly quick for someone with little to no prior knowledge about vector spaces (if you have no idea what a vector is, you might find [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab|this series helpful]]).

Instead, this review of some basic concepts in linear algebra serves two purposes:


- 1.) Disambiguate notation that will be commonly used throughout this website and introduce readers to a more abstract formulation than the matrix algebra they may be used to

- 2.) Provide a smooth transition into the discussion of [[Euclidean_spaces|Euclidean vector spaces]] and tensors

After this review of abstract vector spaces, it will be assumed that you know at least the basics of linear algebra and the properties of vector spaces.

If you feel super confident in your knowledge and feel the first section would be a waste of time, [[Euclidean_spaces| click here]].


If you want to go ahead with the vector review, then the first question we should ask ourselves is, [[What_is_a_vector|What is a vector?]]
